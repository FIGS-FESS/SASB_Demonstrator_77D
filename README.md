# SASB_Demonstrator_77D
This is a port of the SASB Demonstrator to the TI TMS320F28377D Control Card

Pinouts:
  Current Sensor -> Pin 09 (ADCA CH0)
  Displacement Sensor -> Pin 12 (ADCB CH0)
  PWM High -> Pin 88 (GPIO 39)
  
Reference Pins:
  ADCA Clock Signal -> Pin 49 (ePWM1 Compair A)
  ADCB Clock Signal -> Pin 53 (ePWM2 Compair A)
  Length of Displacement calculations -> Pin 89
  
Considerations:
  I do not believe that the code is the best it can be but I can promise it is better than it was. The commenting on the other hand may need more work.
